## Introduction
This is a webpage showcasing a short data-story based on the work done in the DTU 
course: "02806 Social data analysis and visualization-Spring 24" class so far. (This exercise is a kind of "micro version" of what we'll be doing in the final project). Follow the directions in the bulleted list below when you create your data-story.


## The dataset
The dataset which has been worked with is called; "Police Department Incident Reports: Historical 2003 to May 2018" and provides insight into observations of various crimes committed in San Francisco from 2003-2018. 
It consists of 2.13M observations which are categorized into 14 columns. These include e.g. a crime category (prostitution, car theft, robbery), the day and date of the crime, the time, the district and the coordinates of the crime.

## Analysis
In this section, we'll delve into the analysis of SF Crime Data and explore key insights.
